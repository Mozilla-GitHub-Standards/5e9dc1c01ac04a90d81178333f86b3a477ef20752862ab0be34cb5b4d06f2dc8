queuey-py: Python client library for Queuey
===========================================

This is a Python client library used for interacting with messages from a
Mozilla Services message queue. More soon, in the meantime, you can read the
`spec <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Services/Sagrada/Queuey>`_ on the Mozilla
wiki or look at the message queue implementation called
`Queuey <https://github.com/mozilla-services/queuey>`_ itself.

Quick intro
===========

TODO Use this::

    from queuey_py import client

    client = client.Client()
    client.do_stuff()
