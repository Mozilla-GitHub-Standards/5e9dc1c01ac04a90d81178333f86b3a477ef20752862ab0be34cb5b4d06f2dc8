This is a Python client library used for interacting with messages from a
Mozilla Services message queue. More soon, in the meantime, you can read the
`spec <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Services/Sagrada/Queuey>`_ on the Mozilla
wiki or look at the message queue implementation called
`Queuey <https://github.com/mozilla-services/queuey>`_ itself.


.. note:: This code is not yet stable. Please contact
          `Hanno Schlichting <hschlichting@mozilla.com>`_ if you are
          interested.
